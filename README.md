>To store cool ideas and turn them into reality someday.

## Ideas
1. How to GitHub - A project to ease the transition further, by creating it into a project!
2. SoundSync - Tinder for Songs? (Makes more sense in my head)
3. College_Site?? - A student run TSEC site for helpful books, notes, advice, past year papers, seniors contacts, past year placements.
4. 1-on-1 : Chat with people and then at the end of a week- Yes/No to meet 1-on-1.
5. Dev Sync : An App to create Folders which are synced across devices automatically. Powered by G-Drive?
6. Playlist.ai : A music playing platform which takes in a list of songs you already like, forms playlist's from it ensuring equal repetitions.
