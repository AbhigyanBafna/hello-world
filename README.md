### Purpose
To store cool ideas and turn them into reality someday.

## Ideas
1. How to GitHub - A project to ease the transition further, by creating it into a project!
2. SoundSync - Tinder for Songs? (Will make more sense once I create it)
3. College_Site?? - Make a site for college books repository, time tables, labs etc
4. 1-on-1 : Chat with people and then at the end of a week- Yes/No to meet 1-on-1.
5. Dev Sync : An App to create Folders which are synced across devices automatically. Powered by G-Drive?
