**Fire Away ;)**

### Purpose
Just going through the learning curve currently.
But using this for listing ideas to work on sounds great!

## Ideas
1. How to GitHub - A project to ease the transition further, by creating it into a project!
2. AB's Codebase (ABC) - A repo to store code which may be useful for future projects.
3. SoundSync - Tinder for Songs? (Will make more sense once I create it)
4. No_Name - A open source way to upload specific folders to your Google Drive and update them automatically as you make changes to your phone
